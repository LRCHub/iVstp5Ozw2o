Oh my god
Did that just really happen?
Man this night is getting weird
I'm freaking out
And everybody's clapping
Did my clothes just disappear?

It's like I'm looking in the mirror at someone else
Stole my best friends' girl now I'm going to hell
Howling at the moon, no I'm not myself
And I can't believe it
Living up the night with the walking dead,
Who's this monster in my bed?
By five in the morning I'll forget.

I'm gonna lose it
Jump off the roof screaming, "I can fly!"
Dare me to do it
What's taking over my brain tonight?
Must be the music
Must be the music.

This DJ sucks
And I ain't going no where till he plays my favorite song
Give me a shot and
Let me blow your speakers with "You shook me all night long"

And I just spilled my drink
And sold my soul
Lit the house on fire
Gonna rock and roll
Everybody look out cause I've lost control
And I kinda like it.
Living up the night with the walking dead,
Who's this creeping in my bed?
When the sun comes up I won't regret.

I'm gonna lose it
Jump off the roof screaming, "I can fly!"
Dare me to do it
What's taking over my brain tonight?
Must be the music
Must be the music.
I'm gonna lose it
Must be the music.

Must be the music,
That's got me shaking like an addict
Dude, flyin' so high I'm gonna need a parachute
When I come down,
When I come down.

Must be the music

I'm gonna lose it
Jump off the roof screaming, "I can fly!"
Dare me to do it,
What's taking over my brain tonight?
Must be the music
Must be the music.
I'm gonna lose it
Must be the music.

Oh my god
Did that just really happen?
Man this night is getting weird.
